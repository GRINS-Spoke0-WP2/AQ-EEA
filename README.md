# Air Quality data from European Environmental Agency (AQ-EEA)

For the Italian domain, we retrieve measured concentrations of air pollution from the European Environmental Agency (EEA). More specifically, the European agency receives data from the national agency. Data are provided thorugh the [European Air Quality Portal](https://aqportal.discomap.eea.europa.eu/) under the "Data Download" section. Three datasets are available: 
- Airbase
- E1a
- E2a

The difference among them is the different time span and validity check. In particular, the Airbase dataset covers the period from 2000 to 2012, inclusive. The E1a covers the period from 2013 up to last two/three years (2022/2023) and it contains data after a validation process. The E2a is the most updated dataset, it covers the last two/three years, and contains data received from national agency withouth any further check by the European agency.
